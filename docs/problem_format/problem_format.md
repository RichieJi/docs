Each problem is stored in its own directory. That directory must contain a file named `init.yml`.

# `init.yml`
The entire file is a YAML object. It must contain one key, `test_cases`, which maps to a list of test cases. Optionally, but almost always, will there be an `archive` key, which allows the problem data to be stored, compressed, in a `.zip` file, instead of the problem directory as flat files.

# `test_cases`
Each element in the `test_cases` list is a YAML associative array (usually written as a keyed branch) that represents a test case. The element contains the key `points`, mapping to an integer specifying the number of points that test case is worth.

If `points: 0` is specified, getting a non-AC verdict on this case will result in the remaining test cases being skipped.
This also applies to batched test cases where `points: 0` is specified.

However, note that these cases will not be automatically run at the beginning, that is if you specify

```yaml
test_cases:
- {in: case1.1.in, out: case1.1.out, points: 100}
- {in: case1.0.in, out: case1.0.out, points: 0}
```

`case1.1` will be graded before `case1.0`, and getting a non-AC verdict on `case1.0` will result in a verdict of `100/100 (WA)`.

The correct configuration would be:

```yaml
test_cases:
- {in: case1.0.in, out: case1.0.out, points: 0}
- {in: case1.1.in, out: case1.1.out, points: 100}
```

## Normal Cases
For normal cases, the test case will contain keys `in` and `out`, mapping to the path for the input and output files, respectively. The path is in the zip file if `archive` is defined, otherwise relative to the problem directory. A normal case will contain the key `points`.

## Batched Cases
The batch will contain the keys `points` and `batched`. `batched` will map to a list of batched cases, where each case contains `in` and `out`.

Below is a sample `init.yml`:

```yaml
archive: tle16p4.zip
test_cases:
- {points: 0, in: tle16p4.p0.in, out: tle16p4.p0.out}
- {points: 10, in: tle16p4.p1.in, out: tle16p4.p1.out}
- points: 10
  batched:
  - {in: tle16p4.0.in, out: tle16p4.0.out}
  - {in: tle16p4.1.in, out: tle16p4.1.out}
- points: 10
  batched:
  - {in: tle16p4.2.in, out: tle16p4.2.out}
  - {in: tle16p4.3.in, out: tle16p4.3.out}
```
